# Next.js example

A small coffee storefront on the Next.js App Router, localised with
[`@saykit/react`](../../packages/integration-react) and
[`babel-plugin-saykit`](../../packages/plugin-babel).

This is the example to read if you care about **React Server Components**: it renders messages on
the server _and_ in client islands, from a single catalogue serialised across the boundary exactly
once.

## What it demonstrates

| Concern                                                                                    | Where                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `<SayScope>`, resolving the view for the request                                           | `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`            |
| `getSay()` inside a plain server component                                                 | `src/app/[locale]/product-card.tsx`      |
| `SayProvider` at the root, taking its props from the scope                                 | `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`            |
| `<Say>` in a **client** component                                                          | `add-to-cart.tsx`, `locale-switcher.tsx` |
| `generateStaticParams` from iterating a `Catalogue`, whose values are locale-bound `View`s | `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`            |
| Locale detection: path → cookie → `Accept-Language`                                        | `src/proxy.ts`                           |
| Babel wiring (Next.js runs Babel, not a bundler plugin)                                    | `.babelrc`                               |

## The server/client split

`@saykit/react` publishes its `.` entry twice and lets the bundler pick:

- In a **server** environment the `react-server` export condition resolves to a build where `<Say>`
  reads from `getSay()` — the view the enclosing `<SayScope>` put in React's request cache.
- In a **client** environment it resolves to the `"use client"` build, where `<Say>` reads from
  `useSay()` — the nearest `SayProvider`.

The component you write is identical in both cases:

```tsx
<Say>
  Roasted by <strong>{product.roaster}</strong>
</Say>
```

Because both halves are fed from the same `<SayScope>` in the root layout — the client provider
reads its locale and messages straight off it — server output and client hydration cannot disagree
about which locale is active.

## Why `src/config.ts` exists separately

`src/i18n.ts` is marked `server-only` and imports all three catalogues. The middleware and the
locale `<select>` only need the _list_ of locale codes, so that lives in `src/config.ts` on its own.
Importing `i18n.ts` from either would drag the catalogues into the edge bundle and break the client
build.

## Babel, not unplugin

Next.js compiles with its own toolchain, so the macros are rewritten by `babel-plugin-saykit`:

```json
{ "presets": ["next/babel"], "plugins": ["saykit"] }
```

The plugin also rewrites `import en from './locales/en.po'` into an inline object. It requires a
**default** import for catalogue files and throws on a named one — that is the intended failure
mode, not a bug.

> Adding `.babelrc` opts the whole app out of Next.js's default SWC pipeline, which is slower to
> compile. Projects on a Vite-based framework should prefer `unplugin-saykit` — see the
> [TanStack Start example](../tanstack-start).

## Running it

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --filter nextjs-example dev
pnpm --filter nextjs-example extract   # after editing any message
```

Visit `/` for English (served by rewrite), `/fr`, or `/pl`. The chosen locale is persisted in the
`x-preferred-locale` cookie, so a later visit to `/` redirects accordingly.
